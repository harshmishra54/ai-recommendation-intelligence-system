      "It acts by inhibiting the enzyme glutamine synthetase in plants. This enzyme is essential for converting glutamate and ammonia into glutamine, a vital amino acid. By blocking glutamine synthetase, glufosinate ammonium disrupts ammonia detoxification and amino acid synthesis, leading to the accumulation of toxic levels of ammonia within plant cells. This buildup interferes with cellular metabolism and disrupts cell membrane integrity, causing leakage of cellular contents and ultimately leading to plant death. Additionally, the herbicide indirectly affects photosynthesis by disrupting nitrogen metabolism and energy production in chloroplasts."

At the molecular level, Metamifop acts as an Acetyl-Coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) inhibitor. ACCase is a critical enzyme involved in fatty acid biosynthesis in plants. By inhibiting this enzyme, Metamifop disrupts the production of essential fatty acids, which induces chlorosis, prevents the growth and development of the targeted weeds, ultimately leading to their death"
